# self-supervised-learning
The basic idea behind self-supervised learning is to use the structure of the input data to define a supervised learning problem. 

The data itself is used as the supervision signal, by creating a pretext task that can be used to train the model.

A machine learning model learns to make predictions about a particular task from the raw input data, without explicit supervision or labeled data. 

By training on these pretext tasks, the model learns a rich representation of the input data that can be fine-tuned for downstream supervised learning tasks with much smaller amounts of labeled data.
